"1574014993-16","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Massey Competitors in farm and industry sector included:"
"1574014993-23","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","High interest rates after the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, the US economy was affected by stagflation. In an effort to fight excessive inflation, the Fed adopted a tight monetary policy, raising interest rates (as an illustration, the federal funds rate increased from 11% in 1979 to 20% by June 1981).This affected all players as it led to a plunge of stock market prices, on the one hand, and an economic recession, on the other. Furthermore, Massey was particularly hit hard: since it mainly financed its operations with short-term debt, its financing cost went up dramatically."
"1574014993-31","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Alternatives Available:

The major alternatives available to MF are:"
"1574014993-32","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","1) Merger:

Under the current scenario, no company will be ready to merger with MF as:

Company’s shares worth was around $100 million but at the same times additional capital of $ 500 million was required to carry on operations which was not possible under the current circumstances."
"1574014993-30","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","What was more unusual was the fact that it used short-term debt to finance its business operations, fixed asset capital maintenance, and long-term principal and interest repayments. As a result, Massey was much more affected by the increase in interest rates than that of its competitors where MF lost its edge. Cost of debt of MF in 1980 was 229.9 million $ compared to net income of 225.2 million $ that shows the real story."
"1574014993-19","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Therefore if the farm equipment market were to weaken, relatively, Massey Ferguson would find itself in a less favorable position. Along with the increase of risk on projects, the heavy use of debt financing also restricted Massey Ferguson’s financial flexibility. Massey Ferguson’s debt finance structure is spread out among 21 different lending institutions in over nine countries. Each one of these lenders having debt covenants of their own with the arrangement that if one of these covenants were to be broken all of Massey Ferguson’s debt becomes callable."
"1574014993-24","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","2) Low demand"

In 1978 Company had financial loss of US. $262.2 million ."
"1574014993-8","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","It is quite obvious as Massey got $360 million contract to update Peru’s tractor and diesel engine industry."
"1574014993-4","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Massey’s product line consisted of tractors, combine harvesters, balers, forage harvesters, agriculture implements, farmstead equipments and other equipment for agricultural use. Industrial line consisted of Industrial tractors, loaders, rough terrain forklifts, skid steer loaders, utility loaders and skidders."
"1574014993-35","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","3) Liquidation:

If MF goes for Liquidation option same situation remains that:

Stakeholders will not get anything out of it as already company’s financial value is very much down to $5 from 25$ $ 1 million receivables and inventories will not be going to pay at their full that is again loss for the stakeholders. Under the current financial circumstances MF value will further go down if liquidation option is to be considered."

"1574014993-18","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Medium and small enterprises, conducting business locally with restricted range of products.

Named: Deere & co and International harvesters. Massey was traditionally ranked 3 rd in sales of farm equipment behind Deere & Co and International Harvesters. However in 80’s Massey occupied 2nd position in market for small tractors and combine harvesters. In contrast with its competitors, Massey Ferguson chose to finance its expansionary agenda primarily through debt offerings and short term credit lines. This type of structuring had very detrimental implications for Massey Ferguson. The use of so much leverage would increase the risk of the projects they were undertaking beyond the industry standard. Firms in the same industry such as Deere and International Harvester throughout the 1976-1980 period maintained debt/capital and STD/capital percentages consistently lower than Massey Ferguson (a trend that exacerbated as time went on)."

"1574014993-29","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","• Massey’s financing choices over the years brought with them many problems, which aggravated the already grim situation in the product markets. First, during its expansion in the1970’s, Massey levered itself immensely. Compared to its two main competitors, it systematically had the highest Total Debt/Capital ratio (in 1980: 80.85% compared to 53.56% for International Harvester and 40.28% for Deere & Company). While this might have been justified by the growth strategy, it turned out to be very damaging for the company in view of the current situation."

"1574014993-41","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Competitors strategies should be monitored while designing financial structure, don’t act short sighted."
"1574014993-36","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","4) Refinancing:

The last considerable option to MF was refinancing the capital structure so as to bring in the balance between the equity and debt structure.

"1574014993-38","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Financial Advice :

Refinancing is an alternative that is best to be considered, our suggestion to MF are:

MF should convert their debts to equity on immediate basis as debt holders will not get anything if company gets default and by getting shares they will be the part of company’s board of directors as well. On immediate base they can request their stake holders to hold on for certain time frame. Company will pay them interest with betterment in finance positions. Sweeteners or warrants are other option they can offer to debt holders that will bring in something positive to opt for as MF has good chance to come up with finances. Government being the key stakeholder is ready to guarantee the new equity investment in Massey as if company closes its operations ultimately thousands of employees will be direct burden on the govt."

"1574014993-39","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Learning From the Case Study:

The major learning’s from the case study are:"
"1574014993-34","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","2) Divestitures:

Another option that MF has, to cover up its loss by selling any of its unit but financial side of the company and Product-market position doesn’t make this option viable."
"1574014993-17","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Large multinational companies with full product lines"
"1574014993-20","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","These types of restrictions can impede company financial options during down times (as they did when Massey Ferguson attempted an equity issuance in 1978). The emphasis on short term credit lines was also a questionable choice of finance structuring. Expansionary/market penetrating strategies typically pan out by taking losses in the short term in order to realize larger gains in the long term. Along with an expansionary strategy, Massey Ferguson was also increasing spending in R&D for production of higher horsepower tractors to market in North America and for diesel engine production."
"1574014993-7","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","History shows that Massey had been strong in Market outside North America and Western Europe. Massey Production facilities were also across the different region of the world (Exhibit 5). Largest facilities were located in Canada, France, England, and Australia.

"1574014993-40","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Organizations should not aggressively opt for aggressing financing when they are dealing in highly cyclical market where risk is high or highly uncertain. Aggressive debts in good times are not a good financial strategy, organization should create a balance between capital structures and bring in equity financing when in good time. Interaction of product market and financial risk should be carefully considered while carrying on various long term strategies for the organization."
"1574014993-12","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","High Interest rates"
"1574014993-27","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","High exchange rates were another area of concern which damaged the MF as the pound sterling rate was increasing.

"1574014993-33","https://studymoose.com/case-analysis-massey-ferguson-essay","Companies short term debts were about to mature which was another additional burden on the part of company.
